### Introduction

Graph neural netowrks (GNN) have got a lot of "attention" (:-)) in the past decade. Almost every type of data can be represent as a graph. When we combine the power of neural networks with some knwoledge of graph theory, we are able to achieve many tasks related to machine learning, such as node classification, edge prediction and even explainability of networks. In that sense, newtwork analysis can be a powerfull and usesuful approach as an exloratory data analysis approach to GNN. This post will focus on Network Analysis of a real data network present in {refrence, valentin}. But before we dive into some coding, a brief explaination about the data is very welcome

### Disease outbreak

In the domain of epidemiology, an outbreak is defined as a sudden increase in the disease frequency, related to time, place, and observed population {%cite outbreak%}
The outbreaks of certain desease are usually reported by agencies that are spread around the globe. These agencies play a key role to minimize the effects of any epidemics. An alert triggered in a certain region may give enough time to take mesures of preventing a desease to spread. And that is the reason why the agencies must be present in all geographical levels (local, regional and global) on the globe.

However, not every desease is systematycally repported : some deaseases (or syntoms) are not reported by all the agencies that are present in the same region where the outreak is declared. Which may lead to some lack of trust and delay the process of confirming or not a possible outbreak.
