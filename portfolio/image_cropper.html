<div class="container" style="padding: 0;text-align: justify;">
    In this work, I developped a fullstack application that allows a user to send images to the server and crop images based on drag and drop user's interaction
    The user can later download the result. The image processing can be redenred on the server (Springboot) or on the client (Angular). If rendered on the server,
    the images are stored in the database (MongoDB). Images can be deleted by the users.
