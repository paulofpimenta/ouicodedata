<div class="container" style="padding: 0;text-align: justify;">
    In this work, I developped a fully operational web application aiming to perform gender detection using webcams. In the backend, the application was
    developped using Pytorch as a deep learning framework and FastAPI as API python framework. I used FaceApi.js to detect faces and fused that with a 
    frontend application using React.js. More details can be found on [Some Link]({% post_url 2023-06-12-gender-detector-with-pytorch %})
