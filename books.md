    <p>Presents a tutorial-level overview of the methods underlying automatic machine learning, enabling readers to easily understand the key concepts behind AutoML. 
       Offers a comprehensive collection of in-depth descriptions of AutoML systems, allowing readers 
       to see how the key concepts have been implemented in the context of actual systems. Discusses an independent international competition of many different systems, 
       providing an independent evaluation of pros and cons of different AutoML approaches</p>

      <p>This book describes the important ideas in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing in a common conceptual framework. 
      While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of colour graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.
