      <p><strong>About me</strong></p>
      <p>
      <p>Hi o/, </p>
      <p>My name is Paulo Pimenta. I am a computer/datascientist living in France. Born  and  raised in the Amazon region, my passion is computer and data science.
        But I was always very curious about environmental and natural sciences. That curiosity started during my University degree in Information Systems, when I had lectures
        about spatial data. I was amazed with the possibility of using collected data as input to algorithms, and being able visualize in so many different ways.
        Since then, I belive that data is valuable and with the current advances in technology (machine learning and IoT), we can improve decision 
        making process about natural ressources, territory and space management</p>  

      <p>My interest is to work in projects that involves real data collection, data visualization, and application of machine learning
        and deep learning techniques. My goal is to work in any machine learning or any data project that allows me to improve my skills in machine learning, 
        IoT and Data Science.</p>
