    <p><strong>Not so brieflly about me</strong></p>
    <p>
      My name is Paulo Pimenta and I was born in Bel√©m, a relatively big city in
      the Amazon region. I was always interested by technology, and also, by
      environment and natural sciences. I decided to pursue an University degree
      in Information Systems and in the third year of my university pathway, I
      coursed a discipline called Geographic Information Systems GIS. I was
      amazed by the possibility of using data collected from satellites, the
      physical world, and then, visualize them into a map. At that time (2003),
      I was introduced to ArcGIS 8.x, a tool that allowed to to conclude my
      undergraduate thesis. Most of my colleagues went into purely software
      engineering and network subjects and therefore, never understood quite well
      why I was going to this domain
    </p>

    <p>
      And that's where my story with GIS started :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      After graduating, it became a straightforward process to me to associate
      my software development and data skills with my interest about GIS.
      Eventually, it led me to defend a master thesis with collaboration with
      the National Institute Space for Research (INPE), followed by a Phd in Computer Science. 
	    My goal was to facilitate how non-programmers could model environmental systems using multi-agent
      systems, a subfield of reinforcement learning.

      After I graduated from my PhD, I started to dive in the wonderful world of
      Python. With some previous experiences into the world of web development,
      I was, naturally, led to search for Python applications in modelling and
      web development. Spatial data collection, visualization, machine learning
      (and the math behind) are part of my daily use (and learning). My goal is
      to work in any machine learning or data project, specially these with some sort
      of spatial data. My interests are also on how do we increase machine learning
	    productivity using cloud technologies.
