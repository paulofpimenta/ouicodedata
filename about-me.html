      <p><strong>About me</strong></p>
      <p>
      <p>Hi o/, </p>
      <p>My name is Paulo Pimenta. I am a computer living in France, but born in raised in the Amazon region.
        Although my passion is computer science, I was always very curious about environmental and natural sciences. 
        During my University degree in Information Systems, I was passioned by Geographic Information Systems GIS (and what we could do with that).
        I was amazed with the possibility of using big spatial data collected from satellites, apply algorithms to these data and visualize them into a map. 
        Since then, I have been wondering how to use technology to improve decision making process of territory and space management</p>  

      <p>Today, I have a particular interest about any project that involves real data collection, data visualization, and application of machine learning
        and deep learning techniques. My goal is to work in any machine learning or any data project that allows me to improve my skills in machine learning, 
        IoT or pipiline developpment using cloud technologies.</p>
