    Hi o/,
    </p>
    <p>
    My name is Paulo Pimenta. I am a computer/data scientist living in France. I was Born and raised in the Amazon region, and my passion is computer and data science. I was always very curious about environmental and natural sciences. This curiosity started during my University degree in Information Systems, when I had lectures about spatial data. I was amazed with the possibility of using collected spatial data as input to classification algorithms, allowing satellite data to be visualized in so many different ways. Since then, I believe that data is valuable and with the current advances in technology, machine learning and IoT, we can use data to improve decision making process and increase our understanding about natural ressources, territory and space management

    My interest is to work in projects that involves real data collection, data visualization, and application of machine learning and deep learning techniques. My goal is to work in any machine learning or any data project that allows me to improve my skills in machine learning, IoT and Data Science.
